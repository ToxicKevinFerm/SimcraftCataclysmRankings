# Classic Cataclysm Simulationcraft Rankings

I made a simple project to take the latest version (that I could find) of Simcraft for Cataclysm, and apply them to the T11 BIS sims.
Should be the closest approximation we can get pre-beta.

Everything is simmed on SimulationCraft 433-2
for World of Warcraft 4.3.3 Live (build level 15354)
